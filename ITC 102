         <h2>Hey there, my name is "T" (A nickname I go by), and I'm a 26-year-old web design student.
         I moved to Seattle a little over a year-and-a-half ago from Tampa, Florida.
         I basically moved here to escape the terrible heat and giant confederate flags. I currently work as a barista in the Central District, after doing bike shop/mechanic work for five years.
         I do cartooning in my free time, as well as plant-keeping, gardening, and cycling.
         My goal in life is to have a career with limited human contact and a decent salary. I feel like that's everyones dream, though.</h2>
