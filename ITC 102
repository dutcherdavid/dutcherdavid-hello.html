         <h1>A Brief History Of Me:</h1>
         
         <p>
         Hello, my name is David Dutcher. I was born in Las cruces, New Mexico on July 21st 1973. I have lived in New Mexico, California, Florida, Washington, Alaska and Vietnam.
         I have a Bachelor's Degree in Social Work from New Mexico State University. I have an amazingly talented 16 (almost 17) year old daughter. I love hanging out with the kiddo, movies (especially horror), music (anything but country), parkour and mixed martial arts.
         I have lived in Seattle, WA for 17 years. And now I'm a student at Seattle Central College.
